# Running Enterprise

## Peristent disabling of Enterprise processes

* to disable an Enterprise agent persistently without editing policy:

```shell
cf-agent -Dpersistent_disable_AGENT
```

Where `AGENT` is one of `cf_execd` or `cf_monitord` or `cf_serverd` currently.

This will stop the AGENT from starting automatically.

* to re-enable an Enterprise agent

Same `AGENT` choices as above.

```shell
cf-agent -Dclear_persistent_disable_AGENT
```
