Next, run the bootstrap command, **first** on the Policy Server, and then on each Host:

## Production Environment

If you plan to use Community in a production environment, complete the following general requirements:

**Host(s) Memory** 

256 MB available memory in order to run the CFEngine agent software (cf-agent).

**Disk Storage** 

A full installation of CFEngine requires 25 MB. Additional disk usage
depends on your specific policies, especially those that concern reporting.

**Network** 

* Verify that the machineâ€™s network connection is working and that port 5308
  (used by CFEngine) is open for both incoming and outgoing connections.

* If iptables are active on your operating system, stop this service or adapt
  it to allow for communication on the above ports. If applicable, type the
  following two commands: /`etc/init.d/iptables stop` and `chkconfig iptables
  off`
