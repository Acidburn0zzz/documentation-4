#### Agent ####

A piece of software that runs independently and automatically to carry out a task (think software robot). Inn CFEngine, the agent is called cf-agent and is responsible for making changes to computers. 

#### Authentication ####
#### Body ####

A promise body is the description of exactly what is promised (as opposed to what/who is making the promise). The term `body' is used in the CFEngine syntax to mean a small template that can be used to contribute as part of a larger promise body. 

#### Bootstrap ####
#### Bundles for Knowledge ####
#### Bundle ####

In CFEngine, a bundle refers to a collection of promises that has a name. 

#### Call Collect ####
#### Classes ####

#### CMDB ####

A Configuration Management Database. A term coined as part of the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) as an outgrowth of an inventory database. 

#### Commands ####
#### Common Control ####
#### Components ####

Standalone applications include cf-agent, cf-promises, cf-runagent, cf-know, cf-report, cf-hub, cf-sketch

Daemons include cf-execd, cf-monitord, and cf-serverd

#### Host ####

UNIX terminology for a computer the runs `guest programs'. In practice, `host' is a synonym for `computer'. 

#### Hub ####

A software component in CFE Nova and CFE Constellation that works as a single point of management in a local `star-network'. The term hub is sometimes used to mean policy distribution server, but more commonly a running cf-hub process that does report collection from all CFEngine managed hosts. The term hub means the centre of a wheel, from which multiple spokes emerge.

#### Policy Levels ####
#### Policy Server ####
#### Policy Writing ####
#### Policy ####

A policy is a set of intentions about the system, coded as a list of promises. A policy is not a standard, but the result of specific organizational management decisions. 

#### Precedence ####
#### Promise Attributes ####
#### Promise Types ####
#### Promise ####

The CFEngine software manages every intended system outcome as `promises' to be kept. A CFEngine Promise corresponds roughly to a rule in other software products, but importantly promises are always things that can be kept and repaired continuously, on a real time basis, not just once at install-time.

#### Server ####

For historical reasons, certain computers are referred to as servers, especially when kept in datacentres because such computers often run services. 

In CFEngine, cf-serverd is a software component that serves files from one computer to another. All computers are recommended to run cf-serverd, making all computers CFEngine servers, whether they are laptops, phones or datacentre computers.
