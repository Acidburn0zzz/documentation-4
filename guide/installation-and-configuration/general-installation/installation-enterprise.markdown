These instructions describe how to install the latest version of CFEngine Enterprise in a production environment 
using pre-compiled rpm and deb packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat, CentOS, and SUSE.

## General Requirements

CFEngine recommends the following:

**Host(s) Memory** 

256 MB available memory in order to run the CFEngine agent software (cf-agent).

**Disk Storage** 

Plan for approximately 100MB of disk space per host. Provide an extra 2G to 4G of disk space if you plan to bootstrap more hosts later.

**Network** 

* Verify that the machineâ€™s network connection is working and that port 5308
  (used by CFEngine) is open for both incoming and outgoing connections.

* If iptables are active on your operating system, stop this service or adapt
  it to allow for communication on the above ports. If applicable, type the
  following two commands: /`etc/init.d/iptables stop` and `chkconfig iptables
  off`

CFEngine bundles all critical dependencies into the package; therefore,
additional software is not required.

**Requirements for VIOS**

CFEngine Enterprise has [Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) Recognized status](http://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=48493) from IBM.
This means that CFEngine Enterprise has been technically verified by IBM
to be installed in and manage VIOS environments.

During testing, CFEngine Enterprise was seen to use up to 2% of the VIOS CPU
during `cf-agent` runs with the default CFEngine policy. The resource
utilization may vary depending on the policy CFEngine is running.
The VIOS should be configured with Shared Processors in Uncapped mode.

## Policy Server Requirements

### Dedicated OS

The CFEngine Server is only supported when installed on a dedicated,
vanilla OS (i.e. it only has repositories and packages officially
supported by the OS vendor). This is because the CFEngine Server uses
services, e.g. apache, that are configured for CFEngine and may
conflict with other custom application configurations.

One option, especially for smaller installations, is to run the
CFEngine Server in a VM. But please consider the performance
requirements when doing this.

### Memory

A minimum of 2 GB of available memory and a modern 64 bit processor. For a
large number of Hosts (Clients), we recommend 8 GB of available memory per 500
hosts that are bootstrapped to your Policy Server. Contact your sales
representative if you have any questions regarding these numbers.

### Port 80



**Note:** To avoid potential interference with the installation process, start
from a blank system (i.e. no Apache Web Server, etc.).





## Download Packages

[Download CFEngine](http://cfengine.com/product/free-download)

## Install Packages

CFEngine Enterprise is provided in two packages; one is for the Policy
Server (hub) and the other is for each Host (client). 

**Log in as root** and then follow these steps to install CFEngine Enterprise:


1. On the designated Policy Server, install the `cfengine-nova-hub` package:

    ```
        [RedHat/CentOS/SUSE] $ rpm -i <hub package>.rpm
        [Debian/Ubuntu]      $ dpkg -i <hub package>.deb
    ```

2. On each Host, install the `cfengine-nova` package:

    ```
        [RedHat/CentOS/SUSE] $ rpm -i <agent package>.rpm
        [Debian/Ubuntu]      $ dpkg -i <agent package>.deb
    ```

Note: Install actions logged to `/var/logs/cfengine-install.log`.

## Bootstrap

Run the bootstrap command, **first** on the policy server and then on each
host:

```
$ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap <IP address of the Policy Server>
```

## Licensed installations

If you are evaluating CFEngine Enterprise or otherwise using it in an environment with 
less than 25 agents connecting to a Policy Server, 
you do not need a license and there is no expiry.

If you are a customer, please send the Policy Server's public key (`/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub`) to
CFEngine support to obtain a license. CFEngine will send you a `license.dat`
file. Copy the obtained license file to
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles/license.dat`

## Next Steps

When bootstrapping is complete, CFEngine is up and running on your system.

The Mission Portal is immediately accessible. Connect to the Policy Server
through your web browser at http://`<IP address of your Policy Server>`.
