The Design Center is a public repository for customizable CFEngine design 
patterns and code that is deeply integrated with CFEngine Enterprise.

[Sketches][Sketch Structure] are ready-to-use components (e.g.
collections of bundles, support files, etc.) that can be directly
imported and used in CFEngine policies. Most sketches are specialized
for achieving specific tasks, or for maintaining a specific piece of
software, however their scope and capabilities can be varied. They are
organized in categories according to their functionality.

Sketches are managed (installed, configured, enabled and uninstalled)
through a specialized tool called `cf-sketch` which in turn talks to a
specialized Design Center API. That API is available for third-party
integrations.

This is a guide to the Design Center functionality. For the reference
pages for its API and code structure, start with

## Use Design Center Sketches to Deploy Policy

The CFEngine Design Center is a collection of *sketches* which are
reusable, configurable policies. Think of sketches as data-driven code
modules that are written in CFEngine policy language; you can
configure and deploy these modules without mastering the CFEngine
language.

The Design Center also contains tools that help you to manipulate and 
manage sketches: 

* Enterprise users manage and deploy sketches in the Design Center app that is located on 
the Mission Portal console. [Deploy your first policy in the Design Center][Deploy your first Policy].

* Community users manage and deploy sketches on the [command line][Command Line Sketches] by using the `cf-sketch` 
tool.

* third-part integrators can use the Design Center API from the
command line or through the CFEngine Enterprise API. (??? LINK ???)

## The Design Center Sketch Workflow

A sketch is installed, configured, and deployed, as shown in the diagram below:

![Sketch Workflow](DCsketchworkflow.png)

1. Install a sketch from a master repository. At this point, the
sketch is merely a template that cannot do anything because it doesnâ€™t
contain parameters. With CFEngine Enterprise, installations are
handled invisibly.

2. Configure the sketch by providing parameters. Now, you can create
sketch configurations. One sketch can have multiple configurations
with different parameter sets that will get applied under different
conditions. With CFEngine Enterprise, you do this from a GUI screen.

3. Deploy the runfile. This makes the sketch visible to CFEngine, so
it can begin to execute. Typically the intermediate stage here is to
generate a runfile (the policy glue that enables all the Design Center
magic) and check it into your version control repository. With
CFEngine Enterprise, this step is handled invisibly, you just enter a
commit message for the change you've made.

## Value of Sketches to Users

Sketches provide value in many ways:

* Instead of writing a single policy for each desired state, you can
use data-driven policies (sketches) to implement, activate, or enforce
policy. Users can configure the sketch for the appropriate environment
and then deploy it to specific hosts or everywhere without knowing the
intricacies of CFEngine policy language.

* You can have infinitely flexible configurations of sketches across your infrastructure 
based on static (such as CPU or OS) or dynamic (such as time of day or number of users) 
conditions (classes). Every time CFEngine runs, it chooses which sketch(es) to execute with 
which parameter sets based on those conditions. As conditions change, the execution of 
sketches can change, just as the behavior of regular CFEngine policy can change.

* You can also choose to restrict sketches to specific machines or groups of machines.

## Design Center Terminology

* `Design Center`  Refers to the collection of sketches and the tools that allow you to 
manipulate and manage them.
* `Design Center app (UI)` Refers to the Design Center user interface app that is 
located on the Mission Portal console for CFEngine Enterprise users.
* `Design Center in GitHub` Refers to the [CFEngine github][github design-center] repository of sketches, tools, 
and policy examples.
* `Design Center API` Refers to the [API][The Design Center API] which performs all operations related to 
sketches, parameter sets, environments, validations, and deployment.
