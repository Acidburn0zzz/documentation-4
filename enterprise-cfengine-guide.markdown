## CFEngine Enterprise Features ##

### Scalability ###

CFEngine Enterprise can manage many thousands of hosts from a single Policy Server in parallel without blocking.

### Configurable Data Feeds ###

The CFEngine Enterprise `Mission Portal` provides System Administrators and Infrastructure Engineers with detailed information about the actual state of the IT infrastructure and how that compares with the desired state. 

### Federation and SQL Reporting ###

CFEngine Enterprise has the ability to create federated structures, in which parts of organizations can have their own configuration policies, while at the same time the central IT organization may impose some policies that are more global in nature.

### Monitoring and reporting ###

The CFEngine Enterprise Mission Portal contains continual reporting that details compliance with policies, repairs and any failures of hosts to match their desired state.

### Role-based access control ###

Users can be assigned roles that limit their access levels throughout the Mission Portal.
