<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is modularity?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
Modularity is the ability to separate concerns within a total process, and hide
the details of the different concerns in different containers. In CFEngine, this is a
<i>service oriented view</i>, in which different aspects of a problem are
separated and turned into generic components that offer a service.  We
often talk about black boxes, grey boxes or white boxes depending on
the extent to which the user of a service can see the details within
the containers.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is orchestration?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
Orchestration is the ability to coordinate many different processes in
time and space, around a system, so that the sum of those processes
yields a harmonious result through cooperation.

   <p>Orchestration is not about centralized control, though this is common
misperception.  An orchestra does not manage to play a symphony
because the conductor pulls every player's strings or blows every
trumpet in person, but rather because each <i>autonomous</i> player has a
copy of the script, knows what to do, and can use just the little
additional information from the conductor to access a viewpoint that
is not available to an individual. An orchestra is a weakly coupled
expert system in which the management (conductor) provides a service
to the players.

   <p>CFEngine works like an orchestra &ndash; this is why is scales so well. 
Each computer is an autonomous entity, getting its script and a few
occasional pieces of information from the policy server (conductor). 
The coupling between the agents is weak &ndash; there is slack that makes
the behaviour robust to minor errors in communication or timing.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How does CFEngine deal with modularity and orchestration?</h3>

<p>Promise Theory provides simple principles for hiding details: agents are
considered to reveal a kind of <i>service interface</i> to peers, that is
advertised by making a promise to someone.  We assume an agent exerts
best effort in keeping its promises. Orchestration requires a promise
to coordinate and the promise to use that coordination service. 
These basic ideas are built into CFEngine.

   <p>CFEngine provides containers called <i>bundles</i> for creating modular
parts. Bundles can be independent (and therefore parallelizable)
or they can be dependent (in which case the sequence in which they
verify their promises matters).

   <p>In a computer centre with many different machines, there is an
additional dimension to orchestration &ndash; multiple orchestras. Each
machine has a number of resources that need to be orchestrated, and
the different machines themselves might also need to cooperate because
they provide services to one another. The principles are the same in
both cases, but the confusion between them is typically the reason why
large systems do not scale well.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Levels of policy abstraction</h3>

<p>CFEngine offers a number of layers of abstraction. The most fundamental atom
in CFEngine is the promise. Promises can be made about many system issues,
and you described in what context promises are to be kept.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Menu level</i><dd>At this high level, a user `selects' from a set of pre-defined `services' (or bundles in CFEngine parlance). 
In commercial editions, users may view the set of services as a Service Catalogue, from which each
host selects its roles. The selection is not made by every host, rather one places hosts into roles that
will keep certain promises, just as different voices in an orchestra are assigned certain parts to play.

     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     <pre class="smallexample">          bundle agent service_catalogue # menu
          {
          methods:
            any:: # selected by everyone
               "everyone" usebundle =&gt; <b>time_management</b>,
                          comment =&gt; "Ensure clocks are synchronized";
               "everyone" usebundle =&gt; garbage_collection,
                          comment =&gt; "Clear junk and rotate logs";
          
            mailservers:: # selected by hosts in class
              "mail server"  -&gt; { "goal_3", "goal_1", "goal_2" }

                              comment =&gt; "The mailing list handler";
          }
</pre>
     </td></tr></table>

     <p>The resulting menu of services can be browsed in the Mission Portal interface.

     <p><strong class="float-caption"></strong></p></div>

        <br><dt><i>Bundle level</i><dd>At this level, users can switch on and off predefined features, or re-use
standard methods, e.g. for editing files:

        The set of bundles that can be selected from is extensible by the user.

        <br><dt><i>Promise level</i><dd>This is the most detailed level of configuration, and gives full
<i>convergent</i> promise behaviour to the user.  At this promise level,
you can specificy every detail of promise-keeping behaviour, and

libraries, or creating your own.

        <br><dt><i>Spread-sheet level (data-driven)</i><dd>
CFEngine commercial editions support a kind of spreadsheet. In a spreadsheet
approach, you create only the data to be inserted into predefined
promises. The data are entered in tabular form, and may be browsed in
the web interface.  This form of entry is preferred in some
environments, especially on the Windows platform.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Is CFEngine patch-oriented or package-oriented?</h3>

<p>Some system management products are patching systems. They package lumps
of software and configuration along with scripts. If something goes wrong
they simply update or replace the package with a new one. This is a patching
model of system installation, but it is not a good model for repair as it nearly
always leads to interruption of service or even requires a reboot.

   <p>Installation of packages overwrites too much data in one go to be an effective model
of simple repair<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It can be both ineffecient and destructive. CFEngine manages addressable
entities at the lowest possible level so that ultra-fine-grained repair can be
performed with no interruption of service, e.g. altering a field within a line in a file,
or restarting one process, or altering one bit of a flag in each file in a set of directories. 
The power to express sophisticated patterns is what makes CFEngine's approach both
non-intrusive and robust.

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">High level services in CFEngine</h3>

<p>CFEngine is designed to handle high level simplicity (without
sacrificing low level capability) by working with configuration
<i>patterns</i>, after all configuration is all about promising
consistent patterns of system <i>state</i> in the resources of the
system. Lists, for instance, are a particularly common kind of
pattern: <i>for each of the following... make a similar promise</i>. 
There are several ways to organize patterns, using containers, lists
and associative arrays. Let's look at how to configure a number of
application services.

   <p>At the simplest or highest level, we can turn services into "genes"
to switch on and off on your basic "stem cell" machines.

<pre class="verbatim">body agent control 
{ 
bundlesequence => {
                  webserver("on"),
                  dns("on"),
                  security_set("on"),
                  ftp("off")
                  };
}
</pre>

   <p>This obviously looks simple, but this kind of simplicity is cheating
as we are hiding <i>all</i> the details of what is going to happen &ndash; we
don't know if they are hard-coded, or whether we can decide
ourselves. Anyone can play that game! The true test is whether we can
retain the power to decide the low-level details without having to
program in a low level language like Ruby, Python or Perl. Let's peel
back some of the layers, knowing that we can hide as many of the
details as we like.

   <p>A simple, but low level approach to deploying a service, that veteran
users will recognize, is the following. This is a simple example of
orchestration between a promise to raise a signal about a missing process and
another promise to restart said process once its absence has been
discovered and signalled.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent application_services
{
processes:

  "sshd"  restart_class => "start_ssh";
  "httpd" restart_class => "start_spache";

commands:

 start_ssh::
   "/etc/init.d/sshd restart";

 start_apache::
   "/etc/init.d/apache restart";

}
</pre>

   <p>But the first thing we see is that there is a repeated pattern, so we could
rewrite this as a single promise for a list of services, at the cost of a loss
of transparency. However, this is the power of abstraction.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent application_services
{
vars:

  "service" slist => { "ssh", "apache", "mysql" };

 #
 # Apply the following promises to this list...
 #

services:

   "$(service)";

}
</pre>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Hiding details</h3>

<p>Resource abstraction, or hiding system specific details inside a kind of
grey-box, is just another service as far as CFEngine is concerned &ndash; and we
generally map services to bundles.

   <p>Many system variables are discovered automatically by CFEngine and provided
"out of the box", e.g. the location of the filesystem table might be <code>/etc/fstab</code>,
or <code>/etc/vfstab</code> or even <code>/etc/filesystems</code>, but CFEngine allows you to
refer simply to <code>&lt;b&gt;$(sys.fstab)&lt;/b&gt;</code>. Soft-coded abstraction needs cannot
be discovered by the system however. 
So how do we create this mythical resource abstraction layer? It is
simple.  Elsewhere we have defined basic settings.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle common res # abstraction layer
{
vars:

  solaris::

   "cfg_file[ssh]" string => "/etc/sshd_config";
   "daemon[ssh] "  string => "sshd";
   "start[ssh] "   string => "/etc/init.d/sshd restart";

  linux.SuSE::

   "cfg_file[ssh]" string => "/etc/ssh/sshd_config";
   "daemon[ssh] "  string => "sshd";
   "start[ssh] "   string => "/etc/init.d/sshd restart";

  default::

   "cfg_file[ssh]" string => "/etc/sshd_config";
   "daemon[ssh] "  string => "sshd";
   "start[ssh] "   string => "/etc/init.d/sshd restart";

classes:

  "default" and => { "!SuSE", "solaris" };
}
</pre>

   <p>Some of the attempts to recreate a CFEngine-like tool try to hard code
many decisions, meaning that minor changes in operating system versions
require basic recoding of the software. CFEngine does not make decisions
for you without your permission.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Black, grey and white box encapsulation in CFEngine</h3>

<p>CFEngine's ability to abstract system decisions as promises also
applies to bundles of promises. After all, we can package promises
as bumper compendia for grouping together related matters in
a single package. Naturally, CFEngine never abandons its insistence
on &lt;b&gt;convergence&lt;/b&gt;, merely for the sake of making things look
simple. Using CFEngine, you can create convergent orchestration.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent services
{
vars:
 "service" slist => { "dhcp", "ntp", "sshd" };
methods:
 "any" usebundle => fix_service("$(service)"),
         comment => "Make sure the basic application services are running";
}
</pre>
The code above is all you really want to see. The rest can be hidden in libraries that
you rarely look at. In CFEngine, we want the intentions to shine forth and the
low level details to be clear on inspection, but hidden from view.

   <p>We can naturally modularize the packaged bundle of fully convergent
promises and keep it as library code for reuse. Notice that
CFEngine adds comments in the code that follow processes through
execution, allowing you to see the full intentions behind the
promises in logs and error messages. In commercial versions, you can
trace these comments to see your process details.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent fix_service(service)
{
files:

  "$(res.cfg_file[$(service)])"

 #

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Bulk operations are handled by repeating patterns over lists</h3>

<p>The power of CFEngine is to be able to handle lists of similar
patterns in a powerful way.  You can also wrap the whole experience in
a method-bundle, and we can extend this kind of pattern to
implement other interfaces, all without low level programming.

<pre class="verbatim">#

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Ordering operations in CFEngine</h3>

<p>Ordering of operations is less important than you probably
think. We are taught to think of computing as an linear sequence of
steps, but this ignores a crucial fact about distributed systems: that
many parts are independent of each other and exist in parallel.

   <p>Nevertheless there are sometimes cases of strong inter-dependency
(that we strive to avoid, as they lead to most of the difficulties of
system management) where order <i>is</i> important. In re-designing
CFEngine, we have taken a pragmatic approach to ordering. Essentially,
CFEngine takes care of ordering for you for most cases &ndash; and you can
override the order in three ways:

     <ul>
<li>CFEngine checks promises of the same type in the order in which they are defined, unless overridden
<li>Bulk ordering of composite promises (called bundles) is handled using an overall list using the bundlesequence (replaces the actionsequence in previous CFEngines)
<li>Dependency coupling through dynamic classes, may be used to guarantee ordering in the few cases
where this is required,  as in the example below:
</ul>

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Top">Top</a>

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Bundle ordering</h3>

<p>There are two methods, working at different levels. 
At the top-most level there is the master <code>bundlesequence</code>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "bundle_one", "bundle_two", "bundle_three" };
}
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
For simple cases this is good enough, but the main
purpose of the bundlesequence is to easily be able to switch on
or off bundles by commenting them out.

   <p>A more flexible way of ordering bundles is to wrap the ordered process
in a master-bundle.  Then you can create new sequences of bundles
(parameterized in more sophisticated ways) using <code>methods</code>
promises. Methods promises are simply promises to re-use bundles,
possibly with different parameters.

   <p>The default behaviour is to retain the order of these promises; the effect
is to `execute' these bundles in the assumed order:
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent a_bundle_subsequence
{
methods:
  classes::
   "any" usebundle => bundle_one("something");
   "any" usebundle => bundle_two("something");
   "any" usebundle => bundle_three("something");

}
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Alternatively, the same effect can be achieved as follows.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent a_bundle_subsequence
{
methods:
  classes::
   "any" usebundle => generic_bundle("something","one");
   "any" usebundle => generic_bundle("something","two");
   "any" usebundle => generic_bundle("something","three");

}
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Or ultimately:
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent a_bundle_subsequence
{
vars:
  "list" slist => { "one", "two", "three"};

methods:
  classes::
   "any" usebundle => generic_bundle("something","$(list)");

<p>CFEngine is designed to handle non-deterministic events, such as
anomalies and unexpected changes to system state, so it needs to
adapt. For this, there is no deterministic solution and approximate
methods are required. Nevertheless, it is possible to make CFEngine
sort out dependent orderings, even when confounded by humans, as in
this example:

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent order

{
vars:

 "list" slist => { "three", "four" };

commands:

 ok_later::

 any::

  "/bin/echo one"     classes => define("ok_later");
  "/bin/echo two";
  "/bin/echo $(list)";

}

</pre>

<p class="noindent">The output of which becomes:

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Distributed Orchestration between hosts with CFEngine Enterprise</h3>

<p>CFEngine Enterprise edition adds many powerful features to CFEngine, including
a decentralized approach to coordinating activities across multiple
hosts. Some tools try to approach this by centralizing data from the
network in a single location, but this has two problems:

     <ul>
<li>It leads to a bottleneck by design that throttles performance seriously. 
<li>It relies on the network being available. 
</ul>

   <p>With CFEngine Nova there are are both decentralized network approaches
to this problem, and probabilistic methods that do not require the network
at all.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Basic communication methods for orchestration</h4>

<p>The two examples below illustrate the basic syntax constructions for
communication using systems. We can pass class data and variable data between
systems in a peer to peer fashion, or through an Enterprise hub. You can
run these with a server and an agent just on localhost to illustrate the
principles.

   <p>In this first example, three persistent classes, with names following
a known pattern are defined on a remote system (by the agent). The
server bundle then grants access to these using an access
promise. Finally, a function call to <code>remoteclassesmatching</code>
imports the classes, with a prefix to the local system.

<pre class="verbatim">
body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "overture" };
inputs => { "cfengine_stdlib.cf" };

The generic peer function <code>remotescalar</code> can address any other host
running  <code>cf-serverd</code>. The abbreviated interface <code>hubknowledge</code>
assumes that it should get data from a hub.

   <p>Both these functions ask for an identifier; it is up to the server to interpret
what this means and to return a value of its choosing. If the identifier matches
a persistent scalar variable (such as is used to count distributed processes in CFEngine
Enterprise) then this will be returned preferentially. If no such variable is found,
then the server will look for a literal string in a server bundle with a handle that
matches the requested object.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Run job or reboot only if n out m systems are running</h4>

<p>The ability to base local promises on global knowledge seems
superficially attractive in some cases.  As a strategy this way of
thinking requires a lot of caution.  We have to assume that all
knowledge gathered about an environment is subject to errors,
latencies and a dozen other uncertainties that make any snapshot of
remotely assessed current state subject to considerable healthy
suspicion. This is not a weakness of CFEngine &ndash; in fact CFEngine has
mechanisms that make it as reliable as you are likely to find in any
technology &ndash; rather it is a fundamental limitation of distributed
systems, and it is strongly dependent on the architectures you build.

   <p>In the following example, we show how you can make certain decisions
based on global, uncertain knowledge, allowing for the fact that the
information is uncertain. In other words, we aim to err on the safe
side. In this case we ask how could we reboot systems after an upgrade
only if doing so would not jeopardize a Service Level Agreement to have
at least 20 machines running at all times. Since the globally
counted instances of a running process cannot be greater than the actual
number, this particular problem satisfies the constraint of erring
on the side of caution.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The self-healing chain - inverse Dominoes</h4>

<p>A self-healing chain is the opposite of a dominoe event. If a part of
the chain is `down', it will be revived. If these events depend on one
another, then the resuscitation of this part which cause all of the
subsequent parts to be repaired too.

   <p>Let's start with the more common case of the independently repairable
services, such as one might find in a multi-tier architecture:
database, web-servers, applications etc.

   <p>The following example can be run on a multiple hosts or on a single
host, using the aliases described in the example. It illustrates
coordination through the use of CFEngine's <code>remoteclasses</code>
function in the Enterprise edition to get confirmation of the
self-healing structure. In fact, the verification of the self-healing
is optional if one trusts the underlying system.

Clearly, whatever tier 3 is really supposed to do, any promise failure
would result in the same behaviour. If we then correct the policy to make it repairable, the output
heals quickly:

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">A Domino sequence</h4>

<p>A different kind of orchestration is a domino cascade, that starts
from some initial trigger, and causes a change in one host that causes
a change in the next, etc. These examples show how this can easily be
carried out by CFEngine. Dominio cascades can be done with Community
or Enterprise editions, but are limited to single machines in each
step.

   <p>The basic principle is shown below<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

   <p><i>Note: to simulate this on a single host, start the server and agent
with this same file as input, and make aliases to localhost in </i><samp><span class="file">/etc/hosts</span></samp><i>
as described in the example.</i>

When executed, this produces output only on the final host
in the chain, showing the correct ordering out operations. The
sequence also passes a file from host to host as a coordination
token, like a baton in a relay race, and each host signs this
so that the final host has a log of eery host involved in the
cascade.

R: Knocked over host2 and did: first_movement
R: Knocked over host3 and did: second_movement

</pre>

   <p>The average time for such a cascade to complete will be half the
length of the chain multiplied by the run-interval, if normal cf-execd
splaytime is used. Without any splaying, the average time will be the
run interval multiplied by the chain length. The completion time
could be increased by using cf-runagent.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">A Chinese Dragon star pattern</h4>

<p>The Chinese dragon darts back and forth between different hosts,
forming a chain of events, and leaving a trail behind it. This pattern
is much like the Domino pattern, except that it follows a star. The
orchestrated sequence of events follows the dragon from its lair to
the first satellite host, then back to its lair to record the journey,
then out to the next satellite, then back to its lair, etc.

   <p>A prototypical application for this kind of pattern is taking servers, one by one,
off a load balancer (in the dragon's lair) and then upgrading them, before
reinstating them and moving on to the next host.
