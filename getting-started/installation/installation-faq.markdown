### Enterprise Installation ###

#### Can I use an existing PostgreSQL installation? ####

Although CFEngine keeps its assumptions about Postgres to a bare minimum, CFEngine should use a dedicated PostgreSQL database instance to ensure there is no conflict with an existing installation. 

#### Do I need experience with PostgreSQL? ####

PostgreSQL is highly configurable, and you should have some in-house expertise to properly configure your database installation.
