## Getting Started Topics ##

[Integrating the Mission Portal with git][Integrating Mission Portal with git]  The **Design
Center App** requires access to a Git repository in order to manage sketches. This section
describes how to set up the Git repository and how to connect the Mission Portal to
it. (The **Design Center App** is located on the Mission Portal console.)
Instructions for testing the **Design Center App** and for reviewing Git commit logs are also included.

Center App**. It describes how to allow or limit a Mission Portal user's ability to commit
to the Git repository and make changes to the hosts. All Mission Portal changes that users
make through the **Design Center App** can be viewed in the Git commit log.
