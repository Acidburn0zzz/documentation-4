CFEngine runs on every computer individually and each time it wakes
up the underlying generic agent platform discovers and classifies
properties of the environment or context in which it runs. This
information is cached and may be used to make decisions about
configuration.

Classes fall into hard (discovered) and soft (defined) types. A
single class can be one of several things:

* Operating System Classes
    * Operating System Architecture - `ultrix, sun4`, etc.
* Network Classes
    * Unqualified Name of Host. CFEngine truncates it at the first dot. 
      Note: `www.sales.company.com` and `www.research.company.com` have the
      same unqualified name â€“ `www`
    * The IP address octets of any active interface (in the form
    `ipv4_192_0_0_1`, `ipv4_192_0_0`, `ipv4_192_0`, `ipv4_192`)
    * User-defined Group of Hosts
* Time Classes
    * Day of the Week - `Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,...`
    * Hour of the Day in Current Time Zone - `Hr00, Hr01,... Hr23`
    * Hour of the Day in GMT - `GMT_Hr00, GMT_Hr01, ...GMT_Hr23`
    * Minutes of the Hour - `Min00, Min17,... Min45`
    * Five Minute Interval of the Hour - `Min00_05, Min05_10,... Min55_00`
    * Quarter of the Hour - `Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4`
    * Day of the Month - `Day1, Day2,... Day31`
    * Month - `January, February,... December`
    * Year - `Yr1997, Yr2004`
    * Period of the Day - `Night, Morning, Afternoon, Evening` (six hour
      blocks starting at 00:00 hours).


-   The name of an operating system architecture e.g. `ultrix`,
    `sun4`, etc.
-   The unqualified name of a particular host (e.g., `www`). If
    your system returns a fully qualified domain name for your host
    (e.g., `www.iu.hio.no`), CFEngine will also define a hard class for
    the fully qualified name, as well as the partially-qualified
    component names `iu.hio.no`, `hio.no`, and `no`.
-   The name of a user-defined group of hosts.
-   A day of the week (in the form
    `Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ..`).
-   An hour of the day, in the current time zone (in the form
    `Hr00, Hr01 ... Hr23`).
-   An hour of the day GMT (in the form
    `GMT_Hr00, GMT_Hr01 ... GMT_Hr23`). This is consistent the world
    over, in case you need virtual simulteneity of change coordination.
-   Minutes in the hour (in the form `Min00, Min17 ... Min45`).
-   A five minute interval in the hour (in the form
    `Min00_05, Min05_10 ... Min55_00`).
-   A fifteen minute (quarter-hour) interval (in the form
    `Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4`).
-   An expression of the current quarter hour (in the form
    `Hr12_Q3`).
-   A day of the month (in the form `Day1, Day2, ... Day31`).
-   A month (in the form `January, February, ... December`).
-   A year (in the form `Yr1997, Yr2004`).
-   A shift in `Night,Morning,Afternoon,Evening`, which fall into
    six hour blocks starting at 00:00 hours.
-   A 'lifecycle index', which is the year number modulo 3 (in the
    form `Lcycle_0, Lcycle_1, Lcycle_2`, used in long term resource
    memory).
-   An arbitrary user-defined string (as specified in the `-D`
    command line option, or defined in a `classes` promise or body,
    `restart_class` in a `processes` promise, etc).
-   The IP address octets of any active interface (in the form
    `ipv4_192_0_0_1<!-- /@w -->`, `ipv4_192_0_0<!-- /@w -->`,
    `ipv4_192_0<!-- /@w -->`, `ipv4_192<!-- /@w -->`), provided they
    are not excluded by a regular expression in the file
    WORKDIR/inputs/ignore\_interfaces.rx.
-   The names of the active interfaces (in the form
    `net_iface_xl0`, `net_iface_vr0`).
-   System status and entropy information reported by
    `cf-monitord`.
-   On Solaris-10 systems, the zone name (in the form
    `zone_global, zone_foo, zone_baz`).

To see all of the classes defined on a particular host, run

         host# cf-promises -v

as a privileged user. Note that some of the classes are set only if
a trusted link can be established with cf-monitord, i.e. if both
are running with privilege, and the `/var/cfengine/state/env_data`
file is secure. More information about classes can be found in
connection with `allclasses`.
